# OpenGL Project for CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization

# How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is normally test-driven development, however I haven't the slightest idea how to unit test OpenGL. In this case I just started writing code and manually testing to make sure that there were no regressions in each segment. Obviously this would be untenable for a real software project, but presumably there is a better way when the time comes.
My work on the project has given me additional practice in designing C++ projects.
The design process that I followed was hack it together as quickly as possible in the time that I gave to it, and use excessive amounts of caffeine.
I would not apply any of the tactics I used during this project on any real work.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I learned the development strategy of watching an hour of OpenGL YouTube instruction for every line of code written, and another terrible strategy was to hard-code everything just to make it work.
I was unable to iterate very easily on my program because of some poor decisions early on that I was unwilling to devote time to refactoring.
My approach to developing code has not evolved during the project.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
A computer science degree is the shortest distance between where I am now - working full time as a software engineer, and my only goal in life - to work for SpaceX and accelerate the colonization of Mars.
Computational graphics and visualizations give me additional experience and practice in C++ and linear algebra.
